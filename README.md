Periodic Table Information App

Description
------------

A Java console application built to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program reads chemical element data from a text file, creates specific objects based on the element's category (e.g., Halogen, Noble Gas), and allows users to look up details using atomic symbols.

This project demonstrates:

Inheritance: Using an abstract base class (Element) to define common properties.

Polymorphism: Managing different element types uniformly within a single collection.

File I/O: Parsing structured data from an external text file.


Features
--------

Dynamic Data Loading: Automatically loads element data from PeriodicInfo.txt on startup.

Symbol Lookup: Users can query elements by atomic symbol (e.g., H, He, Li).

Category-Specific Properties: Displays unique properties for different element groups (e.g., reactivity for Alkali Metals, conductivity for Noble Gases).

Interactive Loop: Runs continuously until the user enters "exit".
